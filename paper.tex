\begin{abstract}

More and more different kinds of cryptocurrencies are being launched and the value of the existing ones is at an all time high which is still increasing. What they all have in common is that they
rely on some type of blockchain as a public ledger for transactions. Blockchains provide a high degree of Byzantine Fault Tolerance by design.  But blockchains also start
finding new completely different possible use cases. With the idea of the Blockchain 2.0 and the proposed use of
blockchains in things like political voting and identity management the decision which type of consenus algorithm is used to ensure the correctness of the blocks in the chain gets more and more important.
This paper lists some of the most widely used algorithms and describes some of the advantages they provide but also what shortcomings they have compared to each other and also looks at some
existing implementations of these algorithms and the effects they have on the corresponding application.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper some of the most prevelantely used consensus algorithms used in blockchains have been described. Even though the cryptocurrency with the most active peers right now (Bitcoin) uses
a POW type algorithm it is obvious that this algorithm was never designed to handle this amount of peers and transactions and it only gets worse, the more the cryptocurrency becomes known and therefore
more peers join the network. To solve some of the issues different variations of the POW system have been proposed and implemented each with their respective advantages and disadvantages.
Some offer a more ecological way to reach consensus while others claim to be more secure than the the rest. But with each algorithms some shortcomings have to be expected, as solving the problem
of reaching agreement among a high number of distributed peers is not an easy task. There probably will never be a single algorithm which could be considered the best one for every application
and especially for every peer using the application.
